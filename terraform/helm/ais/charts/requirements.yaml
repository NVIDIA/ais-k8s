dependencies:
  #
  # Graphite server.
  #
  # Requires that we have already run 'helm repo add kiwigrid https://kiwigrid.github.io',
  # and also requires a 'helm dependency update' to pull in dependencies.
  #
  #
  # The graphite dependency has been copied locally. We need to change some defaults in the config map
  # for graphite, but the quite large source there is not parametrized via values.yaml.
  # If you edit the configmap after graphite install we'd achieve the same result, but
  # we want to automate everything. We could copy the entire configmap into the parent
  # chart values.yaml to over-ride the few lines we need to, but it is nearly 1000 lines.
  # So instead we copy graphite into our charts directory and modify the config map there.
  # Chances are we'll need more extensive tweaking the the graphite config, anyway.
