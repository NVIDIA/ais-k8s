# Vars for playbooks ais_datafs_*
#

#
# It is recommended that you do *not* include ais_hosts here - it becomes too
# easy to mkfs all filesystems by mistake (eg when extending a cluster).
#
# Example, defining ais_hosts at playbook run time:
#   ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ais_datafs_mkfs.yml -e ais_hosts=cpu-worker-node --become --check


#
# Devices under /dev on which we will build XFS filesystems. Defaults must
# be replaced or over-ridden with -e 
#
# Examples on an HDD system: sda, sdb, sdc, ...
#
#ais_devices:
#  - sda
#  - sdb
#  - sdc
#  - sdd
#  - sde
#  - sdf
#  - sdg
#  - sdh
#  - sdi
#  - sdj
